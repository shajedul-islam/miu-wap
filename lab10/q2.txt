1.	Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?
During the phase of check handler of Event Loop, the setImmidiate function is called.
On the other hand setTimeout is called after the time delay and also block I/O.
setImmidiate allows us to schedule a callback function within the I/O cycle and it guarantees
that the callback function will run first irrespective of any other timer and their delay time.
Also setImmediate will not block the event loop since the event recursive call is executed only on the iteration of next event loop.

2.	Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?
There are multiple phases of the Event Loop. Process.nextTick is called at the beginning of every event loop and in between each event phases.
While on the other hand, setImmediate is called during the check handler phase of the event loop.
process.nextTick is prioritized higher than setImmediate.

3.	Does Node.js has window object?
Even though node.js is build on top of javascript (v8 engine), it does not have the window object.
Window object is a global object in browser. Node, on the other hand runs in the server and hence does not have Window as its global objects.
